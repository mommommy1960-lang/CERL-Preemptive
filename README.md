# Commons Preemptive Ethics Framework (CERL-Preemptive)

## Overview  
The **Commons Preemptive Ethics Framework** is a living, open-source prototype for autonomous ethical accountability in AI and research systems.  
It is built to self-audit, self-verify, and transparently log consent and integrity events in real time.

## Architecture
The framework operates as a distributed microservice stack:

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `consent_ledger.py` | Creates a tamper-resistant ledger of all events and actions. |
| `consent_token_manager.py` | Issues, manages, and verifies cryptographic consent tokens. |
| `consent_validator.py` | Validates data access requests against consent requirements and blocks unauthorized access. |
| `audit_trail_api.py` | Provides a lightweight HTTP interface for external audit retrieval. |
| `verify_module.py` | Scans and validates ledger integrity using hash verification. |
| `consent_api_gateway.py` | Receives and records live consent submissions via HTTP POST. |
| `heartbeart.py` | Emits recurring "proof-of-life" entries every 5 minutes for continuity verification. |

## Purpose  
The project is designed as a **proof-of-concept** for the Commons Initiative:  
⧫ To establish open, verifiable standards for ethical AI research.  
⧫ To create a transparent audit trail for all consent and data-usage events.  
⧫ To prevent tampering, corruption, or loss of ethical accountability.

## Running Locally
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open in GitHub Codespaces or any Python 3.10+ environment.
3. Run the modules in this order:
    ```
    bash
    python consent_ledger.py
    python consent_token_manager.py
    python consent_validator.py
    python audit_trail_api.py
    python verify_module.py
    python consent_api_gateway.py
    python heartbeart.py
    ```
4. The gateway will be available at http://localhost:9090/consent.

5. The audit API will be accessible at http://localhost:8080/ledger.

## Consent Validation

The local `consent_token_manager.py` is a prototype opaque-token ledger. It now checks expiry, optional actor/scope binding, and append-only revocation events. Its tokens are **not signed or encrypted**; do not use this file-based prototype as a production authorization service or expose the token file. Independent security review, protected storage, and integration with the request validator are still required.

The `consent_validator.py` module provides real-time validation of data access requests to ensure compliance with consent requirements.

### Features
- **Automatic Consent Checking**: Validates that consent is granted before allowing access to private or personal data
- **Violation Detection**: Detects and blocks unauthorized access attempts
- **Audit Logging**: Records all validation attempts and violations in the tamper-resistant ledger
- **Flexible API**: Provides both class-based and function-based interfaces

### Usage Example

```python
from cerl_preemptive.consent_validator import validate_data_access_request, ConsentViolationError

# This will raise ConsentViolationError - blocked!
try:
    validate_data_access_request(
        action="access_user_data",
        target="private_data",
        purpose="marketing",
        consent_status="not_granted",
        potential_harm="privacy_violation"
    )
except ConsentViolationError as e:
    print(f"Access denied: {e}")

# This will succeed - consent granted
validate_data_access_request(
    action="access_user_data",
    target="private_data",
    purpose="service_provision",
    consent_status="granted"
)
```

### Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite:
```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_consent_validator -v
```
